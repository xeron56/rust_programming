# Rust Programming: A Comprehensive Tutorial

## Chapter 10: Testing and Maintainability

In this chapter, we will explore Rust's testing framework and best practices for writing maintainable and reliable Rust code.

1. **Unit Tests**
2. **Integration Tests**
3. **Documentation Tests**
4. **Test Organization**
5. **Continuous Integration**

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests in Rust are written using the `#[test]` attribute. These tests are designed to test individual units of code, such as functions or methods, in isolation.

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_add() {
        assert_eq!(add(2, 3), 5);
    }

    #[test]
    #[should_panic]
    fn test_divide_by_zero() {
        divide(10, 0);
    }
}

fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

fn divide(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a / b
}
```

In this example, we have two unit tests: one that tests the `add` function, and another that tests the `divide` function and expects it to panic when the second argument is 0.

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests in Rust are written in a separate `tests` directory and are designed to test the interaction between multiple components of your code.

```rust
// tests/integration_test.rs
use my_crate::*;

#[test]
fn test_integration() {
    let result = add(2, 3);
    assert_eq!(result, 5);

    let result = divide(10, 2);
    assert_eq!(result, 5);
}
```

In this example, we're testing the integration of the `add` and `divide` functions from the `my_crate` module.

### 3. Documentation Tests

Rust also supports documentation tests, which are written as examples in your code's documentation. These tests are automatically run by Cargo during the build process.

```rust
/// Adds two numbers.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use my_crate::add;
///
/// let result = add(2, 3);
/// assert_eq!(result, 5);
/// ```
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

In this example, the documentation for the `add` function includes a test case that demonstrates how to use the function.

### 4. Test Organization

Organizing your tests is an important aspect of maintaining a large Rust codebase. Here are some best practices:

- Place unit tests in the same module as the code they're testing.
- Use the `#[cfg(test)]` attribute to ensure that test code is only compiled for the test environment.
- Use descriptive test names that clearly explain what the test is verifying.
- Group related tests into modules or files for better readability and organization.

### 5. Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is a crucial part of maintaining a reliable and high-quality Rust project. By setting up a CI pipeline, you can automatically run your tests, build your project, and deploy it to various environments.

Here's an example of a simple CI configuration using GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push]

jobs:

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build
      run: cargo build --verbose
    - name: Run tests
      run: cargo test --verbose
```

In this example, the CI pipeline will run the `cargo build` and `cargo test` commands every time a new commit is pushed to the repository.

By following these best practices and integrating Rust's testing features into your development process, you can ensure that your Rust code is reliable, maintainable, and ready for production.
